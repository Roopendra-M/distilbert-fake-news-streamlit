🔍 Overview
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that uses a pre-trained DistilBERT model to detect whether a news article is real or fake. The app is built using Streamlit for an interactive web interface and deployed on Streamlit Cloud, allowing anyone to test news content instantly.

It uses a fine-tuned version of DistilBERT from Hugging Face:
👉 mrm8488/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-fake-news

🎯 Objective
The goal of the project is to:

Help users verify the credibility of news content.

Demonstrate how powerful transformer models can be used in downstream tasks like text classification.

Provide a clean and accessible interface for non-technical users to test the system in real time.

⚙️ Key Features
✅ Pretrained model (no training required): Uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT trained on fake news datasets.

✅ Streamlit UI: Simple and intuitive interface for predictions.

✅ Live Inference: Paste any article or news snippet and get instant results.

✅ Deployment: Publicly available via Streamlit Cloud with a shareable link.

✅ Fast and Lightweight: Uses DistilBERT which is ~40% smaller and faster than BERT.

🧠 Technology Stack
Component	Tech Used
Model	DistilBERT (mrm8488/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-fake-news)
Framework	Streamlit
Backend	PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
Hosting	Streamlit Cloud
Language	Python

🚀 How It Works
Input: User pastes a news article or text.

Tokenization: The text is tokenized using the same tokenizer used during model training.

Inference: The model predicts the label (0 for real, 1 for fake).

Output: The app displays the result as REAL ✅ or FAKE ❌.
